# TEA v1.0
Another RAT that employs the telegram bot api. Requires python 3.7.4. Tested on Windows 7 Enterprise.

Steps:
1. Install the required modules by using "pip install -r requirements.txt"
2. Create your telegram bot by talking to the @BotFather.
3. Go to the file "t_api.py" and fill in the token and username variables with your bot token and your telegram username. This username is used in the bot to identify the correct chat_id so it only talks with the written username.
4. Enjoy.

PD: You can compile it by using the "BUILD.bat".
